Hi! I am currently pursuing a one-year MSc in Data Science at University College London. In May 2025, I graduated from John Cabot University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics & Finance and International Affairs, along with a minor in Business Administration and strong mathematical foundations. I have advanced programming skills and a solid background in data analysis, Stata, Python, R, data visualization, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). On this website, you will find a showcase of my projects that demonstrate my programming skills.
