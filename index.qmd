Hi! I am a postgraduate student with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance and International Affairs from John Cabot University. I have strong programming skills and a solid background in data analysis, Stata, Python, R, data visualization, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). On this website, you will find a showcase of my projects that demonstrate my programming skills.
